    <h1>Michelle-Rose Holmes</h1>
    <p>
      A second year student at Whitireia, studying a Bachelor of IT.
      <br> I have a passion for user experience and keen interest in security. I am currently look for part time
      intership whilst I study or full time intership in the summer of 2020. </p>
    <!-- TODO: Replace the text with a description about yourself. -->
    <p>
      Prior to studying I worked in technical support where I found a passion for IT, troubleshooting, diagnosing and
      solving basic technical issue.
      <br>
      Since starting study, I have found that I really enjoy UX design and concepts of information Security. In 2019 I
      attended KawaiiCom and absolutely loved it. Over the last summer I worked at NZ Uniforms as a Online Co-Ordinator
      where I got practise skills I learnt in Interaction Design Fundamental class to help bring better user experience
      to their online customers.
